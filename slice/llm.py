"""
The one place a model is ever called.

Every architectural concern that touches a model call is enforced HERE, in one
function, rather than sprinkled across the agents:

    typed contracts   the reply is parsed into your schema, or repaired once
    bounded loops     the token fence is checked before the request goes out
    degradation       a named fallback model, a different provider family
    observability     one span per call, no-ops if tracing is not configured
    cost classifying  a 402 means one of two very different things

That last one is worth reading twice. OpenRouter refuses a request BEFORE
running it if the worst case exceeds the remaining balance - so a 402 arrives
with nothing spent. But there are two reasons it can arrive, and they need
opposite responses under pressure:

    your TEAM's key cap is spent    -> routine, go and get a top-up
    the SHARED account is empty     -> every team is about to stop, tell an
                                        organiser immediately

A student cannot tell those apart from a raw error, so we do it for them.
