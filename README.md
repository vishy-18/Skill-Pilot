# Agentic Slice Kit

A starter kit for building a **working agentic slice** in two days.

Not a framework. Not a library. About 1,100 lines you are expected to read,
understand, and edit — because the architecture is the thing being taught, and
you cannot learn an architecture you have imported.

> **Status: spine complete. 64 tests — 61 of them run with no key and no
> network; the three in `tests/test_integration.py` need a live key and a
> reachable provider. `demo/` is next.**

---

## Start here

Click **Open in Codespaces**. Nothing to install — no Python, no Node, no
Docker. You need a browser and a GitHub account.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then paste the key from the registration desk
python -m pytest          # should be green
```

Only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required. Everything else in `.env` is an upgrade
you can add at hour four, not a blocker at hour zero.

## What "agentic" means here

A single-prompt LLM wrapper does not qualify, however clever the prompt. A real
agentic slice demonstrates at least one of:

- **state persistence** across steps
- **autonomous tool or API use**
- **multi-step reasoning or decomposition**
- **human-in-the-loop callback mechanics**

Useful as that list is, one line does most of the sorting: **an agent is a
workflow that can go backwards.** Straight through A → B → C is a pipeline,
however many models are in it. The moment a later step can hand work back to an
earlier one and the run carries on from there, you have the thing. That
back-edge is the cheapest part to leave out and the most expensive to retrofit,
so decide early where yours is.

This kit demonstrates all four. [`docs/PRINCIPLES-BRIEF.md`](docs/PRINCIPLES-BRIEF.md)
is the short version — the ideas, in a page or two, and the file to paste into a
chat when you want a critic rather than an enthusiast.
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) is the long version: nine
principles, tiered by build order, each anchored to the line of code it actually
lives on.

**Read the brief before you write anything.** It will save you the rewrite that
hits teams on the second morning who start with prompts.

## Who does what

A team of four will not all do the same job, and the strongest teams split it
three ways. This is a strong recommendation, not a rule - organise differently if
you have a better idea, but decide deliberately rather than by drift.

| | owns | reads |
|---|---|---|
| **Designer** | the problem and the spec - what it does, what makes an answer wrong, what it refuses | [`docs/DESIGNER.md`](docs/DESIGNER.md) |
| **Builder** | the machinery - environment, the spine, `demo/flow.py`, unblocking everyone else | [`docs/BUILDER.md`](docs/BUILDER.md) |
| **Verifier** | real people using it, the stress test, the design rationale | [`docs/VERIFIER.md`](docs/VERIFIER.md) |

**Everyone starts in the same place.** Part one of
[`docs/DESIGNER.md`](docs/DESIGNER.md) is a guided design session &mdash; about
three hours, any frontier chat, no keys, nothing installed &mdash; and the whole
team should be in it. It produces a spec for your own agent, which is near
enough what a strong preliminary submission has to say. The roles start
mattering on the first morning, not during the fortnight.

The ideas the three guides assume are in
[`docs/PRINCIPLES-BRIEF.md`](docs/PRINCIPLES-BRIEF.md) &mdash; short, and worth
reading before any of them. [`docs/ON-THE-DAY.md`](docs/ON-THE-DAY.md) is the
operational page: keys, money, deadlines, what the two error codes mean, and who
to ask when something non-technical is in your way.

**The Verifier role is not the consolation prize.** Roughly a third of what you are judged on is evidence that real people used
your agent and that you changed it in response - and it is the part almost every
team leaves until the last afternoon, by which point it is too late to do honestly.

## Layout

```
slice/      THE SPINE — read this, edit it, do not treat it as a black box
  records.py    what a run is made of                   stdlib   88
  store.py      durable append-only state               stdlib  246
  config.py     the one place .env is read              stdlib   64
  budget.py     the fences: attempts and tokens         stdlib   94
  llm.py        the ONE place a model is ever called            277
  retrieve.py   chunk / embed / search, in the same db          138
  callback.py   suspend on a human, resume, time out             81
  runner.py     the state machine                               101
  __init__.py   what this package is, and what it is not  stdlib   16

demo/       THE DOMAIN — rewrite this for your own problem
web/        the form a human expert answers on
scripts/    doctor · bakeoff · sync_architecture
tests/      six files — the store, the fences, the callbacks, the runner,
            a check that ARCHITECTURE.md still points at real code, and
            one live-key integration test
```

The split is the point. Swap `demo/` for your problem and keep the machinery.

## Three things that will bite you

**Your Codespaces quota is finite, and how much you get depends on your plan.**
A free GitHub account includes 120 core-hours a month; the Student Developer Pack
upgrades you to Pro, which includes more. On the 2-core machine this repo asks
for, 120 core-hours is 60 hours of actual use. **Check your own** at
[github.com/settings/billing](https://github.com/settings/billing) — the
Codespaces tab shows what you have used against what is included, and it is the
only figure that is definitely right for you.

For scale, measured on this repo in September 2026: **a two-hour working session
on the 2-core machine costs 4.1 core-hours** — roughly 3% of a free account's
monthly allowance, at $0.18 an hour. Storage over the same period was 0.28
GB-hours, which is nothing. That is about thirty sessions a month before the free
tier runs out, so a team has room for the event several times over.

Billing lags a day or so, so a session you have just finished will not show up
straight away.

What actually eats the allowance is not working, it is **walking away**. Closing
the browser tab does not stop a codespace; it idles for 30 minutes first. Stop it
from [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), and consider
dropping the idle timeout to 5 minutes in your Codespaces settings. If you do get
blocked, push your work to a branch and a teammate can open a fresh codespace on
it.

**Your API key has a hard cap.** It is enforced, and it refuses a request
*before* running it if the worst case would exceed your balance — so an
oversized `max_tokens` produces a 402 while you still have credit. Leave
`SLICE_MAX_TOKENS` where it is unless you know why you are changing it.

**Default to the cheap model.** `SLICE_MODEL` is Flash-class and will carry
almost everything. `SLICE_ESCALATION_MODEL` costs roughly thirty times as much
per token. Escalate for the one hard subproblem, deliberately — not by habit
when something is not working and you are tired.

## The bar you are actually being judged against

Working code is necessary, not sufficient. You also owe: three fellow students
who walked your flow with their feedback captured and one visible iteration; a
recorded stress test where a classmate tried to break your agent, and the fix
commit that answers it; a short design rationale saying what your agent does and
where its limits are; and a repo someone else could pick up and continue.

Budget for that. Teams that treat the second morning as a feature deadline rather than a
feedback deadline consistently ship the least convincing demos.
