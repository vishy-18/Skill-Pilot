bakeoff.py - Which cheap model can actually hold a gate loop together?

Price and context you can read off a table. Instruction adherence under a
structured-output contract you cannot - so measure it. Each candidate gets the
same deliberately weak thesis and must return a Verdict as strict JSON.

Scored on what the architecture actually needs:
  parses     - valid JSON at all
  schema     - required fields, right types
  blocks     - correctly BLOCKS a thesis with no falsifiable claim
  specific   - objections that name a defect, not "needs more detail"

~20 calls. A few cents. Twenty minutes of your time buys a decision you would
otherwise make on vibes.

  cp .env.example .env      # then put your inference key on the
  python3 scripts/bakeoff.py  # OPENROUTER_API_KEY line
