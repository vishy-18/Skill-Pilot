"""The smoke test. Spec: demo/SMOKE-SPEC.md

    python scripts/smoke.py run --stub        # no key, no network, no tokens
    python scripts/smoke.py run               # live, two model calls per cycle

A green run proves eleven things at once: the environment builds, the key is
read, a model is reachable, structured output parses into a typed record, the
store creates and appends and reads back, the append-only trigger holds, the
runner dispatches handlers and moves state, the budget counts and survives -
and, the one that matters, work goes backwards.

"""Three inputs, because one paragraph cannot prove everything.

A revision loop needs a weakness that is *fixable from the text*. Make the
paragraph vague and there is nothing to recover; make it specific and there is
nothing to block on. Observed both ways on live runs - three futile revisions in
one direction, a first-pass PASS in the other.

So the default carries one clearly weak field whose fix is buried further down.
Whether a given model takes the bait is a property of the model, not of this
harness, and the run reports which happened either way.
